 * Description:
 *  . Axi CDMA engine, it does transfers between memory and memory, it
 *    only has one channel.
 *  . Axi DMA engine, it does transfers between memory and device. It can be
 *    configured to have one channel or two channels. If configured as two
 *    channels, one is to transmit to device and another is to receive from
 *    device.
 *  . Axi VDMA engine, it does transfers between memory and video devices.
 *    It can be configured to have one channel or two channels. If configured
 *    as two channels, one is to transmit to the video device and another is
 *    to receive from the video device.
